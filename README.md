From an IOT system we have gathered a log of sensor observations as a JSONL text file with the following format:

{"date": "2019-01-01", "time": "14:09:13.010", "input": "sensor_17", "value": 56.65788628257326}
{"date": "2019-01-01", "time": "16:07:09.166", "input": "sensor_23", "value": -6.939272293750748}
{"date": "2019-01-01", "time": "12:18:39.988", "input": "sensor_103", "value": 14.45649620272106}
The dates in the input file are guaranteed to appear in order.

For reporting, we would like you to write a small command line tool to aggregate the data per day, and for each day to report the median value for each sensor. The output file should be in the following format:
{"date": "2019-01-01", "input": "sensor_134", "median_value": 19.09421548912573}
{"date": "2019-01-01", "input": "sensor_121", "median_value": 12.99225035624281}
{"date": "2019-01-01", "input": "sensor_33", "median_value": -30.332243582193147}
